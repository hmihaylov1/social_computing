This conclusion is drawn from an analysis of a directed network representing email interactions. The method involves loading the network from an edgelist file and assigning individuals to departments using data from a JSON file. Out-degree (number of outward connections) for each individual is calculated within the network. By examining communication edges, the script counts instances where sender-receiver pairs belong to the same department or have similar out-degree values.

    "ANSWER: No, departments with 15 or more members are not more tightly connected amongst themselves compared to the overall network.\n",
    "List of departments where this is not true: ['1', '21', '14', '9', '17', '11', '10', '36', '7', '4', '22', '8', '15', '16', '13', '6', '0', '23', '19']\n",

    "The answer to whether departments with 15 or more members are more tightly connected amongst themselves compared to the overall network is no. This conclusion is drawn from an analysis of a directed network representing email communications. The method involves loading the network from an edgelist file and assigning individuals to departments using data from a JSON file. After identifying departments with 15 or more members, subgraphs are created for each department. Metrics such as mutual connections and clustering coefficient are calculated for these subgraphs and compared against the overall network metrics. The departments where this conclusion holds true (not tightly connected amongst themselves) include departments '1', '21', '14', and others listed. This analysis suggests that large departments do not exhibit significantly higher mutual and clustered connections internally compared to the broader network."
