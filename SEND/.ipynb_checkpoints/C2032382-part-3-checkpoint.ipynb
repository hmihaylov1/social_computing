Each message signifies a mutual connection between individuals. Common nodes shared by both networks are used to create subgraphs for analysis. The average clustering coefficient is then computed for these subgraphs, measuring the tendency for nodes to form triangles or clusters of connections. The reported results reveal a higher average clustering coefficient (0.11) in the network representing all message behavior compared to the subset covering the first 28 days (0.08). This difference suggests stronger triadic closure, where nodes tend to form interconnected clusters, within the broader dataset. The analysis showcases how social phenomena like triadic closure manifest in different subsets of the social network based on messaging interactions."

By combining these centrality scores, nodes are ranked to select the most pivotal initial node. The simulation employs breadth-first search (BFS) to propagate information, tracking the timestep needed for complete dissemination across the largest connected component. Centrality measures are justified as they capture different aspects of node importance: direct connections (degree), influence on paths (betweenness), and connections to influential nodes (eigenvector). Node 160 is chosen as the optimal starting point, achieving complete dissemination to all nodes in the component within 4 timesteps. This approach maximizes information spread by leveraging node centrality to minimize dissemination time and reach the widest audience efficiently within the network."

    "The code utilizes degree centrality to select five initial nodes that are likely to maximize information spread efficiency in a directed network of email interactions. By ranking nodes based on their connectivity within the largest weakly connected component, the approach strategically chooses influential starting points. Simulating information spread from these five high-centrality nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS) technique allows for efficient exploration of neighboring nodes, tracking dissemination time across the component. This method leverages node centrality to optimize information dissemination, aiming to achieve complete coverage within fewer timesteps compared to a single-node strategy. The outcome, with dissemination completed in 4 timesteps for the selected five nodes, demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging multiple high-centrality nodes to enhance network connectivity and message reach."
